# Toby Clarke

I am an eager junior web developer. After a successful four year career in accounting, I wanted to explore a new career path that would utilise both a logical and creative mindset. Having completed an intense twelve week coding bootcamp at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), I have fallen for the charms of coding and software development.

I am looking for a back-end or full-stack role in an exciting and progressive company where I can best utilise my newly acquired skills and continue to develop and grow as a coder.

## Skills

#### Full Stack Web Development

I have learnt how to build web and mobile apps across two primary language stacks - Ruby (Ruby-on-Rails) and Javascript (AngularJS / Node) - and have extended my skillset to build hybrid mobile apps using Ionic.

Within this, I have learnt to implement TDD and version control methodologies (e.g. Git) and have a detailed understanding of key testing technologies across many frameworks (e.g. Rspec, Capybara, Karma, Protractor)

Everything I have learnt at Makers Academy came to the fore in a recent hackathon. At the [2015 Euromoney Techsprint](http://graduates.euromoneyplc.com/techsprint/), myself and my team won three awards including '_Most Complete Product_', '_Best Use Of Technology_' and '_Overall Best Project_'.

Below are four of my favourite projects developed during my time at Makers Academy and beyond.

| Project  | Description  | Technology  |
|---|---|---|
| [Instawhoah!](https://github.com/Teeohbee/instagram-challenge) | An Instagram clone - users can post, like and comment on photos  | Ruby on Rails, Paperclip  |
| [Tobester](https://github.com/Teeohbee/chitter-challenge)  | A Twitter-like social status sharing app  | Ruby, Sinatra, Heroku, Rspec, Capybara  |
| [Eurohub](https://github.com/emily-jane/EuroHub)  |  A winning hackathon project aimed at re-imaginging a static intranet | AngularJS, Pusher  |
| [rand(Cast)](https://github.com/ShuflCast/randCast)  | A mobile app to aid and simplify podcast discovery, built for my final project  | Ionic, AngularJS, Ruby, Sinatra, Heroku  |

#### Management and Team Working
- I mentored and coached two direct reports in managerial role at M-Biz Global including their onboarding process and continued development.
- I worked with an Agile methodology in all group work at Makers Academy, including final project [rand(Cast)](https://github.com/ShuflCast/randCast) in which I often led standups and utilised tools such as waffle.io to manage distributed code-bases and pairing teams.
- I have invaluable experience dealing with multi-branched GitHub repos and merge conflicts.

#### Problem Solving
- I enjoyed 'debugging' long before encountering code, in identifying and fixing errors in complex excel spreadsheets and financial calculations while in my role as Accounts Receivable Assistant Manager at M-Biz Global.
- I continued to develop the skill at Makers Academy, enjoying the process of systematically working through a problem.
