# Toby Clarke

Eager junior web developer. After a successful 4 year career in accounting, wanted to explore a new career path that would utilise both a logical and creative mindset. Having completed an intense 12 week coding bootcamp at Makers Academy, has fallen for the charms of coding and software development.

Looking for a back-end or full-stack role in an exciting and forward-thinking company where I can utilise my newly acquired skills and continue to develop and grow as a developer.

## Skills

#### Full Stack Web Development

I have learnt how to build web and mobile apps across two primary language stacks - Ruby (Ruby-on-Rails) and Javascript (AngularJS / Node) - and have extended my skillset to build hybrid mobile apps using Ionic.

Within this, I have learnt to implement TDD and version control methodologies (e.g. Git) and have a detailed understanding of key testing technologies across many frameworks (e.g. Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine, Karma, Protractor)

Below are four of my favourite projects developed during my time at Makers Academy  

| Project  | Description  | Technology  |
|---|---|---|
| [Instawhoah!](https://github.com/Teeohbee/instagram-challenge) | An instagram clone - users can post, like and comment on photos  | Ruby on Rails, Paperclip  |
| [Tobester](https://github.com/Teeohbee/chitter-challenge)  | A twitter-like social status sharing app  | Ruby, Sinatra, Heroku, Rspec, Capybara  |
| [Beerstalker](https://github.com/reteshbajaj/BeerStalker)  |  A web app that sources local meet-ups providing free beer | AngularJS, Meetup API  |
| [rand(Cast)](https://github.com/ShuflCast/randCast)  | A mobile app to aid and simplify podcast discovery, built for my final project  | Ionic, AngularJS, Ruby, Sinatra, Heroku  |

#### Management and Team Working
- Mentored and coached two direct reports in managerial role at M-Biz Global including their onboarding process and continued development.
- Worked with an Agile methodology in all group work at Makers Academy, including final project [rand(Cast)](https://github.com/ShuflCast/randCast) in which I often led standups and utilised kanban tools like waffle.io to manage distributed code-bases and pairing teams.
- Invaluable experience dealing with multi-branched GitHub repos and merge conflicts

#### Problem Solving
- Enjoyed 'debugging' long before encountering code, in identifying and fixing errors in complex excel spreadsheets and financial calculations whilst in my role as Accounts Receivable Assistant Manager at M-Biz Global.
- Continued to develop the skill at Makers Academy, enjoying the process of systematically working through a problem, providing innovative solutions.
