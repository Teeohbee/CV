I am an eager junior web developer. After a successful four year career in accounting, I wanted to explore a new career path that would utilise both a logical and creative mindset. Having completed an intense twelve week coding bootcamp at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), I have fallen for the charms of coding and software development.

After graduating, I formed a team with a few of my peers and entered the [2015 Euromoney Techsprint](http://graduates.euromoneyplc.com/techsprint-2015/) hackathon. After an intense weekend we were delighted to win three awards including '_Most Complete Product_', '_Best Use Of Technology_' and '_Overall Best Project_'. This win was followed by a subsequent job offer from Euromoney and the securing of my first developer role.

I am always on the lookout for new opportunities and roles within exciting forward-thinking companies in order to both utilise and develop my skills as a coder.

## Skills

#### Full Stack Web Development

Whilst at Makers Academy I learnt to build web and mobile apps across two primary language stacks - Ruby (Ruby-on-Rails) and Javascript (AngularJS / Node) - and extended my skillset to build hybrid mobile apps using Ionic.

Within this, I learnt to implement TDD and version control methodologies (e.g. Git) and gained a detailed understanding of key testing technologies across many frameworks (e.g. Rspec, Capybara, Karma, Protractor, NUnit)

This knowledge has been built upon in my role at Euromoney, where I learnt to be productive with C# and .Net within weeks of starting, despite having no prior experience with the language. I have gone on to work on multiple projects - from legacy VB.Net websites to Angular front-ends - all within an agile environment and with a focus on testing. On top of my daily responsibilities, I regularly attend tech talks hosted by Euromoney and feel I gain a lot from attending weekly lunchtime [Code Dojos](https://github.com/Teeohbee/code-dojos).

Below are four of my favourite projects developed during my time at Makers Academy and beyond.

| Project  | Description  | Technology  |
|---|---|---|
| [Instawhoah!](https://github.com/Teeohbee/instagram-challenge) | An Instagram clone - users can post, like and comment on photos  | Ruby on Rails, Paperclip  |
| [Tobester](https://github.com/Teeohbee/chitter-challenge)  | A Twitter-like social status sharing app  | Ruby, Sinatra, Heroku, Rspec, Capybara  |
| [Eurohub](https://github.com/emily-jane/EuroHub)  |  A winning hackathon project aimed at re-imaginging a static intranet | AngularJS, Pusher  |
| [rand(Cast)](https://github.com/ShuflCast/randCast)  | A mobile app to aid and simplify podcast discovery, built for my final project  | Ionic, AngularJS, Ruby, Sinatra, Heroku  |

#### Management and Team Working
- I mentored and coached two direct reports in my managerial role at M-Biz Global including their onboarding process and continued development.
- I worked with an Agile methodology in all group work at Makers Academy, including final project [rand(Cast)](https://github.com/ShuflCast/randCast) in which I often opened standups and utilised tools such as waffle.io to manage distributed code-bases and pairing teams.
- I have invaluable experience dealing with multi-branched GitHub repos and merge conflicts.

#### Problem Solving
- I enjoyed 'debugging' long before encountering code, in identifying and fixing errors in complex excel spreadsheets and financial calculations while in my role as Accounts Receivable Assistant Manager at M-Biz Global.
- I continued to develop the skill at Makers Academy, and have enjoyed putting my skills into practice in my role at Euromoney.
