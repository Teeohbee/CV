## Toby Clarke

A former book-keeper who grew tired of having to ask other developers to automate repetitive tasks. Having completed an intense 12 week coding bootcamp at Makers Academy, has now fallen for the charms of coding and software development. Looking for a back-end or full-stack role in an exciting and forward-thinking company where I can utilise my newly acquired skills and continue to develop and grow as a coder.
